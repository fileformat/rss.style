    title: "Fixed home link source, made into a button"
    content: "The home link wasn't been specific about which &lt;link&gt; element it was using as the source.  Also made it be a button so it stands out a bit more."
  - date: 2026-01-19
    title: "Fixed home link in RSS"
    content: "Fixed the hyperlink in RSS version for the \"for the Xxx Website\" link to use the `<link>` from the feed instead of modifying the feed url. [source](https://github.com/fileformat/rss.style/commit/9faa99b0605e8ecbb4db16b04dbb0a4c3f358aff)"
  - date: 2026-01-12
    title: "Added viewport"
    content: "Added `viewport` meta element to the HTML header so it displays nicely on mobile. [source](https://github.com/fileformat/rss.style/commit/b0fb6043f8c72d1df685f207241d8c6ae9f07e20)"
  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "Added home link"
    content: "Added a hyperlink to the site name in the \"for the Xxx Website\" text. [source](https://github.com/fileformat/rss.style/commit/2ec59ccf1fd18bb28b64d9227d942c2f57ff17b8)"
  - date: 2026-01-04
    title: "Javascript version released"
    content: "After trying to use Google's proposed XSLT polyfill (and failing), I realized that if a Javascript-based polyfill could turn XML into HTML, then I could do it directly in Javascript and skip the XSLT.  And it worked!"
  - date: 2025-08-01
    title: "Discussion started about deprecating XSLT in the browser"
    content: "Google starts discussing deprecating XSLT support in the [WHATWG Github Issues](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11523).  Despite a lot of negative feedback, I think the decision has already been made."
  - date: 2024-04-07
    title: "Feed Analyzer"
    content: "When building the list of example feeds, I made the \"Notes\" column by hand. That got tedious really quicky, so I automated it. Thus, the [Feed Analyzer](https://www.rss.style/feed-analyzer.html)."
  - date: 2023-12-26
    title: "Initial XSLT-based release"
    content: "First public release of RSS.Style, with the styling done via XSLT."
  - date: 2023-12-12
    title: "Registered feed.style domain"
    content: "I was wavering back and forth on the name, and went with `feed.style` for awhile, but later decided that it was too generic, and that everyone would recognize what RSS is."
  - date: "2023-11-15"
    title: "Registered rss.style domain"
    content: "Registered the `rss.style` domain."
